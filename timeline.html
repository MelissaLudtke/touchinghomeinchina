  	<h1>From Mao to Now</h1>
  	<h3>China's Population Policy</h3>
	<p>China’s leaders strategized about its massive population for years before it implemented its one-child policy. When the People’s Republic of China was born in 1949, its founder Mao Zedong wanted families to have many children. But this had changed by the 1970s, when family planning slogans like “later, longer, fewer” (encouraging couples to marry later, space their births, and have fewer children) and “one is not few” galvanized a sharp drop-off in family size – from 5.8 births per woman in 1970 to 2.7 by 1978. Still, in 1979, new leaders linked economic goals with birth planning and sent word out to “encourage one, prohibit three.” The one-child policy was born; it remains in effect today, though officials are loosening its restrictions. </p>

Its success will be gauged by rise in per capita GDP, thus its strong linkage to controlling population growth, which becomes key component of Party leaders’ legitimacy. A mass propaganda campaign — with the slogan "Later, Longer, Fewer” (Wan, Xi, Shao) — is the cornerstone of China’s birth planning.  Local birth control enforcers (a.k.a. “menstrual  monitors”) track a woman’s contraceptive usage, even her menstrual cycle, to detect an out-of-quota pregnancy; then, medical procedures are used to enforce the campaign. These approaches are forerunners to similar coercive measures made part of the one-child policy.</p>

Such a steep decline in fertility in such a short time is unprecedented. At least 70 percent of China’s drop in fertility since 1970 was achieved prior to its launch of the one-child policy.

To succeed will require that China’s population be held to 1.2 billion people (in 2000) with a population growth rate of zero. This will mean 95% of urban couples and 90% of rural couples would have just one child. (In 2000, China had 1.26 billion people; its GDP goal had been achieved by 1990.) Communist Party leaders are influenced heavily by the quantitative projections of Song Jian who demonstrates the food and water shortages China will face if leaders do not institute a one-child policy.  Song argues that a Total Fertility Rate closer to one child per woman than two will be needed if China is going to reach its optimal population of 700 million or less in 2080.</p>

Out-of-plan pregnancies, the directive indicates, should be ended “firmly but early.” Provincial campaigns are begun to stringently enforce birth limits.</p>

			<h2>Tightened Enforcement</h2>
			<p>By now, the “one-veto rule” to tighten enforcement of the one-child policy is in operation. Under this rule, a local birth-planning official who fails to meet birth control targets can be denied promotion or lose his job, even if all other criteria on job performance is acceptable.</p>

			<h2>Adoption Law</h2>
			<p>The Adoption Law of China is enacted. It restricts adoption of orphanage children to childless couples over the age of 35 to ensure that Chinese families don’t bypass population control limits through adoption. Foreigners meeting similar criteria become eligible to adopt from Chinese orphanages. Prior regulations limited foreign adoption to only those of Chinese heritage, non-Chinese with strong ties to the country, or long-term foreign residents of China.  The vast majority of adoptions by Chinese families continues to happen informally.</p>

			<p>Survey of one-child policy reveals a big drop in the China’s Total Fertility Rate (TFR); for the first time, it falls below the replacement level, provoking international and domestic concerns about birth-planning cadres’ harsh enforcement. From this point on, China’s TFR remains below replacement and its sex ratio at birth increases, as many more boys than girls are born.</p>

			<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
			<p>Mid-1990s to late 1990s: A few less-developed counties in China are test sites for experiments in “voluntary” birth-planning policies. Quotas are abolished on the community level and no punishment harsher than a “fee” for an over-quota child is enforced. The result is no rise in the region’s fertility rate. There are also fewer contraceptive failures and abortions reported, and the sex ratio at birth is “more normal.”  Similar approaches are spread to 800 counties in seven provinces.</p>

			<h2>Care For Girls</h2>
			<p>When this census (2000) is compared with the 1990 census, the number of females in the population suggests that more than a quarter of the “missing” girls in the earlier count are being “hidden” as over-quota children; they are not “missing,” as had been presumed. This same year, the Chinese government launches its experimental “Care for Girls” program in Anhui Province. The goal is to learn if incentives promoting the value of daughters counter the rising gender imbalance. Financial assistance is given to one- and two-daughter families. Girls’ education fees are sponsored and pensions are increased for families with girls. These strategies combine to reduce the targeted city’s sex ratio at birth from 125 boys/100 girls in 1999 to 114/100 by 2002.</p>

			<h2>Force By Law</h2>
			<p>After two decades, when China’s one-child policy existed without legal authority, the National People’s Congress passes the Population and Family Planning Law. This law “advocates” but still does not “require” each couple to have only one child and prescribes “social compensation fees” for over-quota children.  Institutions involved with state planning of population and births are legalized and restraints are placed how these laws can be enforced. According to this law, it is the “constitutional duty” of citizens “to practice contraception and limit childbearing.” In Article 22 of the Population and Family Planning Law, treatment of girl babies is addressed: “Discrimination against and mistreatment of women who give birth to female children or who suffer from infertility are prohibited. Discrimination against, mistreatment, and abandonment of female infants are prohibited.” Also, according to this law, “use of ultrasonography or other techniques to identify fetal gender for non-medical purposes or sex-selective pregnancy termination for non-medical purposes, at another's behest” constitutes a crime. It is made illegal for a doctor to reveal the sex of a fetus to expectant parents. As the practice continues in spite of this law, legal and policy directives are issued to reinforce prohibition of fetal sex identification for non-medical purposes.</p>

			<h2>Tipping To Boys</h2>
			<p>China’s out-of-balance sex ratio at birth reaches a high of 121.2 boys born for every 100 girls. In some rural areas, the SRB is reportedly as high as 140 boys/100 girls. By the following year, a population survey reveals there are 32 million more males under the age of 20 than females. It also finds the sex ratios at birth (SRB) are highest among one- to four-year olds, spiking in rural areas with 126 boys born for every 100 girls. In this age group, SRBs of more than 130/100 are reported in six rural provinces. Among first-born children, the SRB is near normal; it rises sharply with the births of second children. In nine rural provinces, the SRB for second children is more than 160/100. </p>

			<h2>Discarding One-Child Rules</h2>
			<span class="cd-date">2015</span>
			<p>Illustrative of the gradual easing of the one-child policy, the Public Security Bureau of Guangdong Province no longer requires that couples show a family-planning compliance certificate before they can get a household registration (<em>hukuo</em>) for a baby, as was required for more than three decades. Before July, parents had to receive a certificate from the Health and Family Planning Commission confirming that the couple did not break any rules in having the baby; if they broke rules, they had pay all the mandatory fines associated with an out-of-plan birth. In doing this, Guangdong joins two other provinces, Shandong and Hubei, that issued similar directives late in 2013 that prohibit linking <em>hukuo</em> registration with family planning certificates.</p>
