    <h3>Curriculum</h3>
    <h5>China, Gender, Identity, Population Policy, and Multicultural America</h5>
    <p style="font-size: 21px; line-height: 1.4">Developed by global educators, <em>Touching Home in China’s</em> interdisciplinary and transmedia curriculum is aligned with national standards and applicable for middle school, high school and college level studies in World and American History, Asian Studies, Global Studies, Ethnic Studies, Women’s Studies, English/Language Arts, and more. Each of our six lesson plans is presented in tandem with one of the transmedia stories on this website. These stories emerge from the cross-cultural encounters of American teens wrestling with their dual identity as Chinese-born daughters adopted into Caucasian families and only-child daughters growing up in rural China today.</p>
    <p>Using our lesson plans, teachers and students explore a wide range of topics – contemporary China, gender, identity, race, population policy and multicultural America, to name a few.  Curated resources – as video, audio and print stories – are identified by recommended reading level. They appear as links on the lesson plans and on a linked resource page, organized by group topics. These resources expand and deepen student learning by connecting them with current news stories and academic papers. Current resources are provided also on Touching Home in China’s social media platforms – <a href="https://www.facebook.com/touchinghomeinchina">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/touchinghomechi">Twitter</a>.</p>

    <h3>Dear Teacher</h3>

    <p>Age-level instructions are provided for students from middle school through the early years of college. Our goal is to inspire and deepen student engagement with societal issues in China and America at a time when the lives of citizens of these two nations often intersect. Our six core stories offer students a unique perspective on contemporary life in China since they are told through the cross-cultural experiences of <a href="http://touchinghomeinchina.com/the-girls.html">eight girls</a>, each of whom was born in rural towns in China’s Jiangsu province. The two adoptees came to America as nine-month old babies in June 1997; they are longtime friends. The six Chinese girls grew up in the same two rural towns where the American girls were abandoned as infants during the one-child policy era in China.</p>

     <p><em>Touching Home in China: in search of missing girlhoods</em> is published on two digital platforms. Its transmedia stories can be absorbed in a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/author/melissa-ludtke/id901521745?mt=11">series of six iBooks</a> created optimally for iPads, though these books work well on other MAC computers, too.  The six stories are also available – with the same content – on this website. A few interactive elements work differently on this website than in the iBooks. Using the iBook, students interact more directly, for example, with our population policy timeline, “From Mao to Now,” which is a story element in <a href="index.html#abandoned-baby">“Abandoned Baby.”</a> On the website, students don’t see China’s changing fertility rate due to the straight line in our <a href="timeline.html">timeline</a>. In the iBook version, our up- and-down timeline clearly shows this changing rate; clickable red dots along the line invite students to discover what happened each year.</p>

    <h3>Challenge Based Learning</h3>

    <p>The girls’ stories and this curriculum exemplify the best marriage of content aligned with rigorous standards to create an engaging transmedia exploration for strong readers in secondary classrooms and higher education courses. Each aligned lesson is organized using <a href="http://www.apple.com/br/education/docs/CBL_Classroom_Guide_Jan_2011.pdf">Challenge Based Learning</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/br/education/docs/CBL_Classroom_Guide_Jan_2011.pdf"></a>(akin to Project Based Learning), a collaborative learning experience in which educators and students research and learn about compelling issues in compelling ways, propose solutions to real world problems, share their findings within their community, and take action.</p>


    <p> Critical for the success of Challenge Based Learning are the following:</p>
    <ul>
            <li>For educators to act as a project manager or mentor rather than as a disseminator of information. </li>
            <li>For educators  to set benchmarks (including how students will be evaluated) and schedule regular check in meetings with student groups throughout the process.</li>
            <li>For educators to facilitate opportunities for students to formulate solutions to real world problems.</li>
            <li>For students to direct their research that is leading them toward proposing a solution.</li>
            <li>For students to create presentation products exhibiting their research and demonstrating their learning. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the Challenge Based Learning approach is new, take a moment to <a href="http://www.apple.com/br/education/docs/CBL_Classroom_Guide_Jan_2011.pdf">familiarize yourself</a> with the general principles and helpful best practices to maximize success in the classroom. </p>
    
    <h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>

    <p>Integral for the success of Challenge Based Learning is access to technology commonly used in 21st century life and work. Ideally this includes computers, rich media design tools and the Internet for content, creation and communication. </p>

    <p><em>Touching Home in China: in search of missing girlhoods</em> is published as a series of iBooks and as multimedia stories on this website. The content of its stories is the same, though a few of our interactive elements in the iBook work differently on the website. One advantage of using the iBook is introducing students to its interactive population policy timeline, “From Mao to Now,” which appears in “Abandoned Baby.” The website’s timeline appears as a tab on our navigational bar.</p>
    
    <p>In addition, since you and your students will work in teams – and not all of the work will take place during class – access to a collaborative digital workspace available to everyone  is essential. At a minimum, the workspace will include a calendar, a place to store notes and documents, a questions and connections log, and other digital assets such as PDFs, video clips, and audio and video podcasts. Students should hold onto their questions and connections log – an informal journal to collect ongoing learning, research and thinking – for use in their Reflection and Action Project.</p>

    <h4>Student Skills</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ability to brainstorm in small groups</li>
            <li>Ability to manage well both individual and group time</li>
            <li>Technology and research skills</li>
            <li>An openness to work collaboratively</li>
            <li>Ability to complete assigned tasks within a group and communicate outcomes with team members</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Lesson 1: Abandoned Baby</h3>
    
    <div class="img img-half right">
      <img src="images/curriculum/abandoned-baby-ibook.jpg"/>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Big Idea:</strong> When government intersects with families’ lives.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Guiding Question:</strong> What are the generational consequences of China’s one-child policy?</p>
    <p><strong>Our Challenge:</strong> To discover how a population policy affects families, society and a nation. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Guiding Activities:</strong> This lesson introduces students to the lives of Jennie Yuchang Lytel-Sternberg and Maya Xia Ludtke, Chinese girls abandoned as babies and adopted into Caucasian families in the United States. In meeting these two characters, students have the opportunity to explore the consequences of China’s population policy on individuals – in China and America  – and on the lives of families, the broader society, and the nations.</p>

    <h4> 1 - Setting the Scene </h4>
    
    <p>Read the opening section of <a href="http://touchinghomeinchina.com/index.html%23abandoned-baby">Abandoned Baby</a>. (Stop at the beginning of “Strong on Man, Light on Woman” section. For now, skip the embedded links if reading it on the Touching Home in China website.)</p>

    <p>Ask students to react to what occurred in the opening of this story. Is this the first time they are hearing about this happening? If not, how else did they hear about it?</p>

    <p>After sharing their initial learning, ask students to read the  information at <a href="http://www.sociology.uci.edu/files/docs/ChinaFertility_WF.pdf">this link</a> and <a href="http://factsanddetails.com/china/cat4/sub15/item128.html%23chapter-0">this link</a> about the one-child policy and China’s <a href="http://www.gov.cn/english/laws/2005-10/11/content_75954.htm">laws</a> relating to the abandonment of  children.<sup><a href="#ftnt1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup> For upper-level middle school students, use this <a href="http://factsanddetails.com/china/cat4/sub15/item128.html%23chapter-0">one-child policy link</a>.</p>

    <p>In small groups have students complete a 3-2-1 exercise: List 3 new details you learned, 2 surprising details, and 1 question that remains. Discuss your 3-2-1 responses in pairs or in small groups. Ask each pair/group to share questions that surfaced with the class.</p>

    <p><strong>Guiding Resources:</strong> Hyperlinks in the website version of <em>Touching Home in China</em> direct students towards source material that expands contextual knowledge, prompts new inquiry, and guides them in responding to research questions. Direct students to source material appropriate to their age, reading level, conceptual understanding, and learning objectives. Along with our lesson plans, we provide <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWnnyd2mK_wcdQ7RUmQsEW44M-Uw74lAPXjXkw6-Ltg/pubhtml#">curated resources</a> in which each story or video is cataloged by subject and reading level and the content is described.</p>

    <h4> 1 - Setting the Foundation</h4>

    <p>The interactive timeline in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/abandoned-baby/id993259972?mt=13">iBook</a> and the web version timeline, <a href="http://touchinghomeinchina.com/timeline.html">"From Mao to Now,"</a> provide students with a self-directed approach for understanding how the one-child policy fits into the broader context of China's conception and implementation of various population policies.</p>

    <p> Work through the timeline with the entire class, taking note of critical moments, key leaders and developments that explain turning points in the evolution of China’s population policies. Discuss with students what might be unfamiliar or confusing details, and then encourage them to engage in deeper level of self-directed investigation. For younger students, it will be helpful to direct them toward key dates/leaders/documents to facilitate deeper understanding of how and why the one-child policy came to be and to explore the societal changes it brought.</p>

    <h4> 1 - Engaging Our Challenge</h4>

    <p>To begin the research stage of our lesson plans, divide the class into small groups. Each group will be assigned to explore one of four consequences related to China’s one-child policy. Each group’s task is described, below. Depending on class size, topics can be assigned to more than one group.</p> <p>Prepare each student and each group to do the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Read the entire <a href="/index.html#abandoned-baby">Abandoned Baby</a> story and engage with its various media elements paying special attention to the group's assigned consequence.</li>
        <li>Conduct independent research as a group on its assigned consequence, using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWnnyd2mK_wcdQ7RUmQsEW44M-Uw74lAPXjXkw6-Ltg/pubhtml#">curated resources</a> provided in the curriculum and seeking independent sources of information. Source material is identified by recommended reading level.</li>
        <li>Develop and refine the group’s guiding questions, with teacher providing support and encouragement. </li>
        <li>Work collaboratively as a group to create a culminating project that illustrates the consequence based on research findings. Prior to asking the students to engage in research, introduce and explain this concluding expectation to the students, allowing ample time to discuss and respond to questions. A full description of possible culminating projects is included in the “Reflection and Action Project” section at the end of the lesson. </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Group A: China’s Gender Imbalance</strong></p>
    
    <div class="img img-full">
      <img src="images/curriculum/gender-imbalance.jpg"/>
    </div>

    <p>One of the major identifiable shifts to result from China’s one-child policy is the rapid increase in this country’s gender imbalance. The long-standing cultural belief that daughters are not as valuable to families as sons combines with the government-enforced one-child policy to result in boys soon outnumbering girls starting at birth. Today, China leads the world with its highly distorted sex ratio at birth. </p>

    <p>Students will examine China’s population policies as they prepare to address the following questions:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Describe what factors led to China experiencing its distorted gender imbalance during the decades of its one-child policy.</li>
        <li>Discuss as a group: Was this gender imbalance intentional? If not, should leaders have been able to predict that it would happen? Be prepared to state clearly your rationale and provide evidence used to reach your conclusion.</li>
        <li>What do you see as the consequences – cultural, familial, economical and cultural – of this gender imbalance?</li>
        <li>While out of the scope of this story, ask the students to explore factors that led the Chinese leadership to announce an end to its one-child policy in October 2015? What, if any, population policy is now operating in China?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Click <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWnnyd2mK_wcdQ7RUmQsEW44M-Uw74lAPXjXkw6-Ltg/pubhtml#">here</a> to explore the curated resources for Group A. </p>

    <p><strong>Group B: Impact on Girls’ and Women’s Lives</strong></p>

    <div class="img img-full">
      <img src="images/curriculum/only-daughter.jpg"/>
    </div>


    <p>The one-child policy has disproportionately affected girls in China. For example, due to the decisions that this policy forced families to make, many girls are “<a href="http://works.bepress.com/david_smolin/9/">missing</a>” from the nation’s population. Students will explore China’s centuries-old cultural beliefs and the recent decades of its one-child policy to understand how girls’ lives have been affected by this policy. Information is found in the main story and curated resources earmarked for this section. Students will focus their attention on the impact on girls’ lives to prepare to address the following questions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>What cultural beliefs and practices favor sons over daughters? What differences, if any, do you find in the attitudes of urban and rural families in China?</li>
        <li>What circumstances might lead families to abandon their daughters? Are there circumstances that have led families to abandon sons?</li>
        <li>When the term “missing girls” is used, what does it mean?</li>
        <li>When a couple raises a daughter as its only child are her the opportunities different than they were for girls raised in previous generations in China? If so, why and how. </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Group C: Care of the Elderly</strong></p>
    <div class="img img-half right">
      <img src="images/curriculum/care-of-the-elderly.jpg"/>
    </div>
    
    <p>Consequences of the one-child policy are not limited to girls or young parents. This policy’s rippling effects are now reaching China’s elderly.  Students will explore what is happening to traditional patterns of China’s elder care after nearly four decades of the one-child policy. Students examine the challenges that relate to elder care in  preparing to address the following questions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>How has the one-child policy affected the care of elderly people in China?</li>
        <li>What cultural beliefs, including those about gender, and economic considerations have led families to develop the traditional patterns of care for elders in China?</li>
        <li>Read the China’s’ New Family Form box in the <a href="http://touchinghomeinchina.com/daughter-wife-mom.html">Daughter, Wife, Mother</a> story in <em>Touching Home in China.</em> What do you discover in this graphic about a Chinese family’s situation as it relates the potential challenges of elder care? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Click <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWnnyd2mK_wcdQ7RUmQsEW44M-Uw74lAPXjXkw6-Ltg/pubhtml#">here</a> to explore the curated resources for Group C. </p>

    <p><strong>Group D: Coming to America</strong></p>
    
    <div class="img img-full">
      <img src="images/curriculum/coming-to-america.jpg"/>
    </div>
    
    <p>Beginning in the 19th century, Chinese immigrants settled in the United States. Since then, distinct waves of immigrants have come from China, bracketed by the restrictive laws put in place by the American government from the late 19th century into the mid-20th century. As students learn about these various eras of Chinese migration to the United States, they will focus on the changing composition of the Chinese coming to America, up to and including the wave of recent adoptees.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>What factors have affected the migration experiences of Chinese people to America during different periods of time?</li>
        <li>Prior to the early 1990s, the adoption of Chinese children by Westerners did not exist. What factors in China contributed to the rise in international adoptions?</li>
        <li>With most adoptees from China being raised in Caucasian families, what are some of the likely challenges they experience growing up in America? Are there things their families do to help their adopted children integrate their Chinese heritage into their American lives?</li>
        <li>Why would adoptees want to go back to a country where they were abandoned?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Click <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWnnyd2mK_wcdQ7RUmQsEW44M-Uw74lAPXjXkw6-Ltg/pubhtml#">here</a> to explore the curated resources for Group D.</p>

    <p><strong>All Groups: Wrap-Up</strong></p>
    
    <p>As a class, come together to discuss if other consequences of China’s one-child policy stood out to individual students or groups. If so, what are they? Ask students to reflect on how the one-child policy was responsible for these consequences.</p>

    <h4> 1 - Reflection and Action Project</h4>
    
    <p>A critical element of the curriculum involves students completing a culminating Reflection and Action Project to assess and demonstrate their learning. In doing this project, students have an opportunity to conceptualize an approach to solving an issue/problem at the core of their research. (Solving a problem does not necessarily mean coming up with a definitive solution; it can include finding fresh approaches to drawing greater public awareness to a policy and/or its consequences.) Student groups will come up with a concept appropriate for their reading and grade level that visually represents a challenging idea from their research. (Keep in mind that the content in this lesson might be emotionally sensitive for some class members or others in your school or greater community. Be aware of how ideas and individuals might be visually represented.) Students will sketch their concept, and then develop a proposal for completion. Depending on time allotted, some of their visual expressions can be readied for display as an in-class gallery.</p>
    
    <p>Here are various inroads for students to take into designing their Reflection and Action Project:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Have students explore “Lonely Childhoods and Missing Girls” (Gallery 1 in Abandoned Baby) to learn how three contemporary artists use different forms of creative expression to convey emotional responses to the consequences of China’s one-child policy. (Each artist’s work is displayed in two slides with descriptive captions.) Students should also watch these videos: a Touching Home in China interview with artist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dd6OPVbb2hmE">Meng Site </a> and a video produced by Prune Nourry, the artist who created <a href="https://vimeo.com/79253556">“Terracotta Daughters</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Ask students to learn about what happens to children in your community when their own families are no longer able to care for them. Ask them to research the various roles government agencies in America play in caring for and supporting children whose families cannot care for them. They should use this information to think about ways that the treatment of such children might be improved.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Ask students do an oral history interview with a young person whose family recently immigrated to America. Why did his or her family come to America? What has been easy about the transition to life in America and what’s been difficult? Does he or she hope to return to the place they came from? When? Why? Based on what you learn in doing this oral history, choose an evocative “moment” that conveys an immigrant’s perspective and write it as a scene in a play, bringing to life the characters that portray this what happened in this person’s life as an immigrant.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Consider the following observation made by a Beijing mother, and then read the two stories cited, below:

            <li><em>As one Beijing mother told reporter Alexa Olesen, citing child-rearing constraints faced by wage-earning parents who live in costly cramped apartments and are accustomed to raising one child, “having a second kid isn’t as simple as adding another pair of chopsticks.</em></li>

    <h3>Lesson 2: Touching Home</h3>
    
    <div class="img img-half right">
      <img src="images/curriculum/touching-home-ibook.jpg"/>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Big Idea:</strong> How personal identity is shaped. </p>
    <p><strong>Guiding Questions:</strong> What parts of who I am are influenced by what I think of as “home?” </br> How does where my family or ancestors come from affect how I think about my own identity?</p>
    <p><strong>Our Challenge:</strong> To explore how individual identity is shaped by physical, societal and cultural environments and traditions.</p>
    <p><strong>Guiding Activities:</strong> This lesson invites students to immerse themselves in the many meanings associated with the idea of “home” and how it relates to one’s personal sense of identity. In <em>Touching Home</em>, Maya Xia Ludtke and Jennie Yuchang Lytel-Sternberg, who were born in China and adopted into Caucasian families in the United States, get to know Chinese girls who grew up in the rural towns where the Americans were abandoned as babies by their birth families in the time of China’s one-child policy. Through these girls’ cross-cultural encounters, students explore the central roles that place, language and culture hold in shaping a person’s evolving sense of identity.</p>  

    <h4> 2 - Setting the Scene </h4>
    <p>Read the opening section of <a href="http://touchinghomeinchina.com/touching-home.html">Touching Home</a> and watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7e77AUU2GU">this short video</a>. Stop at the story’s “Home” subtitle.</p>
    <p>Ask students to react to the ideas and interactions they find in the opening of this story. Encourage them to talk about relationships they see forming among the girls in the video and discuss the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Why is Maya returning to Xiaxi Town?</li>
        <li>Can the students imagine what it would be like to go back to a place they don’t remember but where their family or ancestors lived? To a different country? To a different town?</li>
        <li>Have students revisit what the local Xiaxi women talk about when they first meet Maya. What assumptions do they have about her? Where she comes from? </li>
        <li>If the students could ask Maya about meeting these village women and the young woman who combed her hair, what would they want to know? </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Following this discussion have students use what they’ve read and seen in Touching Home so far – and any prior knowledge they bring to their reading – to respond to several writing prompts. At the end of this lesson, the students will return to their initial reflections to gauge how their perspectives might have shifted as a result of what they learned in moving through this Challenge Based Learning lesson.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What makes someone an American? </li>
        <li>How does someone decide whether to add a hyphen to describe who she is in relation to her nationality, such as Chinese-American or Mexican-American?</li>
        <li>If you went back to the country that your ancestors are from, do you think you’d feel like a foreigner? (If you have made such a visit, describe your feelings when you were there.)</li>
        <li>What role do a nation’s cultural traditions play in shaping identity?</li>
        <li>How does knowing the language deepen cultural understanding?</li>
        <li>How can a person go about getting to know a culture different than his own? </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4> 2 - Setting the Foundation </h4>

    <p>For adopted children, like some first-generation immigrants, feeling at “home” in their families, schools and communities can be challenging. It’s not easy to fit oneself into the American narrative of the “melting pot” when that requires assimilating into the dominant culture. Often there are feelings of being sandwiched between one’s family’s ancestral cultural roots and one’s own striving to plant “new” roots of identity in America. An exploration of such feelings is woven into the fabric of Maya and Jennie’s journey “home” to China as adoptees.</p>

    <p>Each girl grew up as a daughter in a mixed-race family and now, as teenagers, she is constructing her own identity using the many pieces of her life as a baby born in China and a girl raised in America. </p>
    
    <p> This lesson plan directs students to delve more deeply into topics of personal identity and adoption by reading <a href="https://littlelilybigworld.wordpress.com/2015/12/09/white-rice-with-soy-sauce/">White Rice (with Soy Sauce)</a> from Lily Rau’s blog “Little Lily, Big World” and <a href="http://projectpengyou.org/meet-lilach-project-pengyou-intern/">"Meet Lilach"</a> by Lilach Brownstein. Ask each student to choose one sentence from either piece that captures an aspect of the girl’s challenges in finding her own identity. In pairs, small groups, or before the entire class, students will explain why they chose this particular sentence by describing what it says to them and by connecting the girl’s insight to their own understanding of identity. </p>
    
    <p>Transition from this discussion to asking students to read the entire story of <a href="http://touchinghomeinchina.com/touching-home.html"><i>Touching Home</i></a>. This story offers glimpses (via words and videos) of the initial meetings of the American adoptees with Chinese girls who grew up in the rural towns where these Americans were abandoned as baby girls during China’s one-child policy. As students absorb this story, ask them to keep in mind how the American and Chinese girls think about identity. </p>
    
    <p>Remind students that the hyperlinked words in the website version of <i>Touching Home </i>take them to material that expands their contextual knowledge about these topics and prompts new paths of inquiry. (Students should only be directed to read source material appropriate to their age, reading level, conceptual understanding, and learning objectives.) </p>
    
    <p>Direct students to watch each video in this story. Doing this will help them get to know some of the <a href="http://touchinghomeinchina.com/the-girls.html">eight girls</a>, <a href="http://touchinghomeinchina.com/the-girls.html"> the two Americans and six Chinese teens</a> who are the project’s main characters. Students should take notes on their new learning. </p>
    
    <h4>2 - Engaging Our Challenge</h4>
    
    <p>In <i>Touching Home</i>, Maya and Jennie confront this core question: <b>“How does this place that I left as a baby contribute to my sense of who I am today?” </b>Their search for identity is informed by their adoptive experience – by being uprooted from this place and their birth family and raised in as a member of a family of another race that lives in a wholly different culture. By having students engage with these girls’ search reminds them that as individuals we carve our own identity out of the varied elements that comprise the entirety of our lives. </p>
    <p>This Challenge Based Learning lesson has students using the experiences of Maya and Jennie as a springboard to considering people’s journeys of discovery about identity. In examining this theme, students will gain insight into ways that their life experiences inform their own sense of identity.To do this, divide the class into small working groups in which they explore in-depth one of the four themes about identity that emerges from <i>Touching Home.</i> In these small groups, they can discuss how their own journeys connect with or diverge from those of Maya, Jennie and the Chinese girls. To foster constructive discussion, encourage students to share new insights and questions from their readings. What the students learn in their small group interactions will resurface when they work on this lesson’s culminating Reflection and Action Project. </p>
    
    <p>(1) Before dividing the class into groups, spend time as a class building students’ background knowledge on international adoption and Asians in America by reading and discussing the following source material. </p>

    <ul type=disc>
        <li>A <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/investigate/adoption/history.html">general background</a> of the history of international adoption in the United States </li>
        <li><a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/adoption/timeline.html">The Adoption Project</a> Timeline </li>
        <li>A<a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/asianamericans-graphics/"> graphical display </a>of the immigrant experience of Asians when they come to the United States. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>(2) Divide the class into the four thematic discussion groups (or more groups, based on class size, with roughly five students to a group.) Assign each group one the following four topics that relate to what they’ve encountered in <i>Touching Home: </i>International Adoption; Identity, Race and Adoption; Living in a Transracial Family, and Being Asian in America.</p>

    <p><strong>Group A: International Adoption</strong></p>

    <div class="img img-full">
      <img src="images/curriculum/group-2a-photo.jpg"/>
    </div>

    <p>Views vary widely about the opportunities and the challenges that international adoption presents to children and families. For each family and adoptee the experiences, struggles and celebrations will be different. After reading a selection of sources about international adoption, students should be prepared to discuss these questions:</p>

    <ul type=disc>
        <li>What are common beliefs about the benefits of international adoption? What are some of the challenges experienced by adoptees, adoptive families, and birth families?</li>
        <li>In what ways does being removed as a child from one culture to be raised in another make identity formation more complex and challenging? </li>
        <li>How is international adoption different than adoption within the United States? What, if anything, is similar? </li>
        <li>What ethical issues arise when a family considers adopting a child from one culture into another and/or from a country with fewer economic resources and opportunities to one with more economic advantages? </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Group B:</b><b><i> </i></b><b>Identity, Race and Adoption</b></p>

    <div class="img img-full">
      <img src="images/curriculum/group-2b-photo.jpg"/>
    </div>


    <p>International adoption adds a layer of complexity to conversations we have about identity and race. Race is inalterable, so families and adoptees learn to navigate through the range of societal perceptions about racial difference. Individuals make personal choices about their lives as a result of the environments and attitudes they encounter; a person’s sense of self changes based on experiences she has. After reading a selection of sources about identity, race and adoption, students should be prepared to discuss these questions. </p>

    <ul type=disc>
        <li>How does the cultural inheritance of one’s birth country and adoption into a different culture interact to shape a person’s identity? </li>
        <li>Which elements of personal identity are inalterable? Which ones are fluid?</li>
        <li>What experiences can lead to changes in self-identity? </li>
        <li>How does being adopted from China and raised in America complicate the search for personal identity?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Group C: Living in a Transracial Family </b></p>
    
    <div class="img img-full">
      <img src="images/curriculum/group-2c-photo.jpg"/>
    </div>


    <p>Most children adopted from China grow up in a family in which the parents (or a parent) do not share their racial or cultural heritage. Visible differences distinguish members of transracial families in ways that often make strangers question (and sometimes ask) if they are a family. As students discover more about the lived experiences of transracial families, they should reflect on the following ideas and be prepared to discuss these questions:</p>
    <ul type=disc>
        <li>Counselors often advise families considering the adoption of a child of another race or from a different country to confront both the negative and positive internalized attitudes about adoption and race. An <a href="http://www.path2parenthood.org/article/transracial-adoption-it-will-change-your-family-forever">article</a> that refers to <i>Inside Transracial Adoption </i>quotes the book’s authors, Gail Steinberg and Beth Hall, as saying “When you choose to become a family that is different from most, you must be prepared to confront your own biases in both overt and subtle ways … You can expect to find that you carry within yourself both negative and positive internalized attitudes about adoption and race.” Why is it important for parents to do this? </li>
        <li>When strangers react to a family’s mixed racial composition, how might parents and children, depending on their age, respond?<b> </b></li>
    </ul>
    <ul type=disc>
        <li>Think about the various ways and strategies that families approach raising a child of a different race and/or culture? </li>
        <li>[Upper high school and university level question.] How do the words used to describe foreign adoptions and the families created by them – “multiracial,” “transracial,” “international” and “transnational” – convey different meanings about the experience? Does it matter which word is used? Why? </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Group D: Being Asian in America </b></p>

    <div class="img img-full">
      <img src="images/curriculum/group-2d-photo.jpg"/>
    </div>

    <p>As children move through adolescence, they are very aware of how others perceive them. At the same time, they wonder how, as individuals, they fit into the larger society. Chinese adoptees growing up in Caucasian families bump up against societal perceptions based primarily on how they look - while at the same time they wrestling with visible differences within their own family. This second layer of complexity sets them apart from children born and raised in Chinese-American families. As students read more about being Asian in America, they should keep in mind these questions as they read and discuss this topic.</p>
    <ul type=disc>
        <li>Is it important for a person to explore his/her own identity? Why?</li>
        <li>When you see a person whom you assume is Chinese in America, what do you think you know about him or her? How did you learn this about them? </li>
        <li>What compels us to classify people into categories based on their looks and/or where their family comes from? </li>
        <li>What are stereotypes? How do they get created? In what ways do we internalize these external descriptions of who we are?</li>
    </ul>


    <p>Click <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWnnyd2mK_wcdQ7RUmQsEW44M-Uw74lAPXjXkw6-Ltg/pubhtml"> here</a> to explore the curated resources for Group D. </p>
    <p><b>All Groups: Wrap-Up </b></p>
    <p>Each group selects one question that deeply engaged them and chooses the resource that most significantly informed its discussion. If time permits, organize students into smaller jigsaw groups to allow for greater exchange of learning. When time is short, each group chooses a representative to present the question and a summary of the group’s selected resource to the class. </p>
    
    <h4><b>2 - Reflection and Action Project</b></h4> 

    <p>A critical element of this curriculum involves students completing a culminating project to assess and demonstrate their learning. In doing this project students have an opportunity to try out various approaches to the issues or topics they explored through Engaging the Challenge. The students should not expect to “solve” the problem – in the sense of finding a definitive answer – though they can try to come up with ideas about how to draw greater public awareness to the situation and/or its consequences. This might lead them to developing messages and creating personal connections to shift attitudes and behaviors and inspire future action. By reflecting on what they’ve learned and using this knowledge to inform ideas about actions, students gain deeper appreciation for the numerous strands of challenges that confront people when they set out to “solve” a problem or try to excite other people to take action on an issue. </p> <p>This lesson’s Reflection and Action Project asks students to consider their own identity – and ponder their journey that led them here - as they respond to this series of related questions: </p> <p>“When I think of my identity, what are the words I use to describe myself?” </p> <p>“How do others, including friends and family, describe my identity?”</p> <p>“What do I want others to know about who I am?”</p>

    <p>Encourage students to use their “questions and connections” logs, compiled during small group learning, as a source of inspiration for their project. </p>

    <p>In this Reflection and Action Project, the form students use to express their ideas is intentionally open-ended. Since this type of self-expression might already feel new in a classroom setting, teachers might consider encouraging each student to challenge herself by choosing a method of expression that is new and unfamiliar. For example, if a student is comfortable expressing herself in writing, she might use clay or paint for her project or expand her forms of writing by using digital media as a part of her storytelling. Another student who is more comfortable expressing himself through art might try writing and performing a spoken-word poem, and so on. Offering students the option to accept this challenge by choice can open up avenues for creativity that will deepen their experience with the content.</p> <p>Working in teams (and not necessarily the same ones as formed for Engaging the Challenge), students support each other in this creative process. As each student begins to think through ideas, team members serve as sounding boards for one another. Once a student completes a draft,, a team member reads and critiques this effort. As the student’s draft nears completion, the original reader continues, acting now as an editor and/or critic. With this start-to-finish collaborative process – along with the teacher’s oversight and guidance – each student’s final submission will be of publishable quality. The students decide how, when, and where to publish their work. Ideally, their projects will be shared among all members of the class, and then possibly with other students in the school, and potentially made public on a digital platform.</p>

    
    <h3>Lesson 3: Daughter. Wife. Mother.</h3>

    <div class="img img-half right">
      <img src="images/curriculum/3/cover.jpg"/>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Big Idea:</strong> How societal expectations and norms for girls and boys influence their lives.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Guiding Question:</strong> How have more than three decades of China’s one-child policy transformed the lives of girls, women and families?</p>
    
    <p><strong>Our Challenge:</strong> To reveal and examine ways in which people’s cultural beliefs, social climate and government policies shape gender expectations and, in turn, how those lead to generational family patterns.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Guiding Activities:</strong> This lesson guides students in learning about current gender roles in China through exploring the changes set in motion after three decades of its one-child policy. In the story, <i>Daughter. Wife. Mother.,</i> teen girls who were abandoned as infants in China and adopted by American families return to their “hometowns” to discover what it’s like to be a daughter in rural China. Girls their age who grew up in these two towns are their guides. The girls’ cross-cultural encounters offer students contemporary glimpses of what it’s like to be a daughter, a wife and a mother in rural China today, and this lesson plan provides probing questions and supplemental sources to stimulate their learning.</p>

    <h4>3 - Setting the Scene</h4>
    
    <p>Read the opening section of <a href="http://touchinghomeinchina.com/daughter-wife-mom.html">Daughter. Wife. Mother.</a>, including the resources found at the various hyperlinks. Stop at “My Name” subtitle.</p>
    <p>Discuss with students new information they learn from the opening section with these prompts in mind.</p>
    
    <ul type=disc>
        <li>What conventions do Chinese families follow in naming their female and male children?</li>
        <li>What different words are used in naming female and male children? What roles, wishes or expectations do these words reflect?</li>
        <li>In what ways do names signify different gender roles in Chinese society?</li>
        <li>Reflect on how names change over the course of a life for women and for men.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Following this discussion, ask students to continue reading <i>Daughter. Wife. Mother., </i>stopping at the subtitle “Left Behind Child.” Remind them to watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kMWQ2PNuBU">video</a> in which Maya’s Chinese friends in Xiaxi Town – Yuan Mengping, Chen Chen and Yujiao Yan – explain the meaning of their names and those of their male family members.</p>
    <p>Have students talk about their reactions to what they learned in these videos and any new information they learned.</p>
    <p>Transition by explaining to students that among parents’ first responsibilities is choosing a name for a child they give birth to or adopt. This name might be the same as another family member or be selected because of the family’s religious or cultural traditions.</p>
    <p>Our names give us an enduring connection to our family as they become part of our identity. With this in mind, ask students to write what they know about why they were given their name along with its meaning, if they know. Ask them to share this in class. When students do not know this history, suggest that they talk with family members and record the story in writing and share with their class the next day. </p>

    <h4>3 - Setting the Foundation </h4>

    <p>Students will use this <i>Daughter. Wife. Mother</i>. story and<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWnnyd2mK_wcdQ7RUmQsEW44M-Uw74lAPXjXkw6-Ltg/edit#gid=1780738335"> curated resources</a> to explore ways that different societal expectations for girls and boys shape an individual’s sense of identity and the potential structure of his or her life’s possibilities. By sharing stories about their experiences with gender, Maya and Jennie, the six Chinese girls, their mothers and grandmothers help us to understand better how cultural traditions shape their lives in America and China.</p>
    <p>The students’ opening exercise engages them in thinking about how societal expectations of girls and boys affect their lives. Begin by asking them to draw their responses to the prompts, below, given to the the girls in<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ_Hx8CcMwE"> the video</a>. (The boys respond to the prompts as boys.)</p>
    
    <ul type=disc>
        <li>When was the first time you knew you were a girl (boy)? What was your reaction?</li>
        <li>What is a difficulty that you overcame (because you were a girl/boy)? </li>
        <li>What is your dream? Or what do you imagine about your future – your personal life or your career?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Students can share their drawing in pairs or small groups after finishing their pieces. After sharing, ask students to write reflectively for a few minutes on how they learned what it means to be a boy or a girl, and how those stereotypes impact their own actions, decisions and dreams for the future.</p>
    <p>Transition to asking students to finish reading the story <i>Daughter. Wife. Mother.</i> As they read the story, remind them to take note of gender expectations in China, including how they are learned, how they are changing over time, and the influence they have on individuals’ lives.</p>

    <h4>3 - Engaging Our Challenge </h4> 

    <p>In <i>Daughter. Wife. Mother</i>, Maya and Jennie learn how their lives might have unfolded as girls growing up in China. Each was adopted as a baby into an American family. Like other Americans raised in well-off, highly educated families, Maya and Jennie will encounter few constraints in choosing their life path. For the <a href="http://touchinghomeinchina.com/the-girls.html">six Chinese girls</a>, all of whom are only-child rural daughters, their life choices are likely to be more constrained by societal and family expectations of the roles they are expected to assume as a wife, mother and elder caregiver. Even among the girls whose higher educational attainment opens up new career pathways, the pressures placed on them to conform to conventional gender roles intensify as they reach their late 20s.</p>
    <p>This Challenge Based Learning lesson builds on the experiences of three generations of Chinese women – the daughters, who are peers of Maya and Jennie, and these rural daughters’ mothers and grandmothers – to reveal how girls’, women’s and families’ lives are being transformed in contemporary China. By observing the generational shifts in women’s lives, students reflect on the lesson’s Guiding Question: <b>“How have more than three decades of China’s one-child policy transformed the lives of girls, women and families?” </b></p>
    <p>Divide the class into four discussion groups – or more groups, based on class size – with roughly five students to a group. Assign each student to one of the four groups aligned with sections of this story - “Only Child Daughter,” “Becoming a Wife,” “To Be a Mother,” and “Voicing Discontent.” Direct each group to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWnnyd2mK_wcdQ7RUmQsEW44M-Uw74lAPXjXkw6-Ltg/edit#gid=1780738335">curated resources</a> to explore ways that different societal expectations for girls and boys shape an individual’s sense of identity and sketch possibilities. <i></i>To foster discussion, encourage students to share insights and ask each other questions based on their reading, viewing and listening. Remind students that what they discover in their small group interactions will be used in the work they do on their culminating Reflection and Action Project.</p> <p>Each group will explore its topic using the general principles of <a href="http://www.apple.com/br/education/docs/CBL_Classroom_Guide_Jan_2011.pdf">Challenge Based Learning</a> with the following directions in mind:</p>
    
    <ul type=disc>
        <li>Assign a facilitator and a recorder (note taker) for each group. These roles can rotate among students.</li>
        <li>Individually, or as a small group, students will read the informational material assigned to each group and talk about how each story or article speaks to their theme and the story told in <i>Daughter. Wife. Mother. </i>As they read students should also consider how their learning connects to their own lives. Each group should discuss and note their findings, as well as write down questions that arose for them in thinking more deeply about this topic.</li>
        <li>Have students share any unanswered questions and unresolved connections that they explored in their discussions. Students should hold onto their questions and connections logs to use in their Reflection and Action Project.</li>
        <li>Invite students to make use of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWnnyd2mK_wcdQ7RUmQsEW44M-Uw74lAPXjXkw6-Ltg/edit#gid=0">curated resources</a> selected for each group using the tab for Lesson Three.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Group A: Only Child Daughter</strong></p>

    <div class="img img-full">
        <img src="images/curriculum/3/a.jpg" />
        <div class="caption-text"> Yuan Mengping with her parents and grandmother in Xiaxi Town.</div>
    </div>

    <p>For centuries in rural China families raised daughters with the expectation that once she becomes a wife she belongs to her husband’s family. A daughter upheld the honor of her own family by fulfilling the obligations of her husband’s filial piety for his parents. China’s one-child policy, which began in 1980, combined with the country’s fast-paced economic growth during the 1990s, brought about changes in how rural Chinese daughters are raised and how they think about marriage and motherhood. For many only-child daughters, the generational changes have been dramatic, mostly due to the family’s investment in their education. </p>
    <p>As students revisit the story’s sections “Left Behind Child” and “Only Child Daughter,” they will do additional reading and research these topics using the<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWnnyd2mK_wcdQ7RUmQsEW44M-Uw74lAPXjXkw6-Ltg/edit#gid=1780738335"> curated resources</a> to prepare to discuss these questions: </p>

        <li>How has being a daughter in rural China changed due to the one-child policy? </li>
        <li>Why are many children in rural China raised by their grandparents or other relatives? What is the customary experience of left-behind children in China?</li>
        <li>In what ways are changing gender demographics in China affecting traditional practices of Chinese families? </li>
        <li>How are older generations in China affected by the one-child policy? What does it mean for China to become a nation of 4-2-1 families?</li>

    <p>China’s one-child policy led to higher educational attainment by many only-child daughters. But societal and family pressures combine to push these same daughters to become wives by their mid-to late-20s, and then mothers soon after. Well-educated women who chose to remain single are stigmatized and labeled “leftover women.” In this group, students will re-read the section “Becoming a Wife” and research the topic using these<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWnnyd2mK_wcdQ7RUmQsEW44M-Uw74lAPXjXkw6-Ltg/edit#gid=1780738335"> curated

    <p>Becoming a mother during China’s one-child policy era could mean having to relinquish a child born outside of the locally enforced regulations governing family size and composition. At times, this wrenching decision was not the mother’s to make; often the husband’s family members made this decision. Sometimes families in rural China left a child with relatives to raise mothers and fathers went away as migrant workers. Today, the pressures on younger women are different as the Chinese government is encouraging them to have and raise two children. In this group, students will re-read the section “To Be a Mother” and research this topic using the<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWnnyd2mK_wcdQ7RUmQsEW44M-Uw74lAPXjXkw6-Ltg/edit#gid=1780738335"> curated resources</a> to prepare to discuss these questions:</p>
    
    <ul type=disc>
        <li>How are China’s population policies affecting women in their roles as mothers?</li>
        <li>How is being raised as an only-child daughter influencing young Chinese women’s thinking about what their lives might be like as mothers?</li>
        <li>How are women’s situations with work outside the home related to their decisions about having children?</li>
        <li>What similarities and differences do you find between mothers in America and those in China when it comes to the lives they lead and the expectations society has of them?</li>
        <li>What is the same or different about being a single mother in China and America?</li>

    <p>At a time when many families in China are raising only-child daughters due to the country’s longtime one-child policy, many more girls are becoming highly educated than in prior generations. Higher education offers the young women wider exposure to on-going gender inequities – from their experience with university admission quotas favoring boys to the exclusion they confront in enrolling in certain academic disciplines, from the discrimination they encounter as women entering a competitive job market to the harassment some endure at work and on public transportation. As a result, a women’s rights movement has emerged among younger Chinese. The government’s arrest and jailing of five prominent women activists in the spring of 2015 now means that public protest about such discrimination needs to be less publicly displayed. Instead, women turn to the courts to redress discrimination in the workplace and work out of public view to advocate for strengthening laws such as those regulating domestic violence. In this group, students will reread the section “Voicing Discontent”and research the topic using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWnnyd2mK_wcdQ7RUmQsEW44M-Uw74lAPXjXkw6-Ltg/edit#gid=1780738335">curated resources</a> to prepare to discuss these questions:</p>
    
    <ul type=disc>
        <li>What cultural forces in rural China conflict with girls’ ambitions to break out of the expected cycle of marrying young and having children soon? </li>
        <li>Describe what difference it can make to be a girl in rural China who is raised in a family that does not have a son.</li>
        <li>What role, if any, are China’s courts and judges playing in addressing gender discrimination? </li>
        <li>Describe how the trajectories of the lives of the six Chinese girls, whom Maya and Jennie come to know, are likely to differ from their American friends. Explain why.</li>
        <li>What is it like for young women in China to challenge the status-quo when it comes to trying to change how girls and women are treated? What forces do they confront?</li>

    <h4>3 - Reflection and Action Project</h4>

    <p>A critical element of this curriculum involves students completing this culminating project to assess and demonstrate their learning. In doing this Reflection and Action Project, students will think critically about the gender roles they explored in their groups.</p>
    <p>Assign students to new groups; each group will have in it at least one representative from each of the four Engaging Our Engaging the Challenge topic groups – “Only Child Daughter,” “Becoming a Wife,” “To Be a Mother” and “Voicing Discontent.” Have each group pick a card with one of the following descriptions listed: </p>
    
    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
        <li>1. One-child rural daughter raised by her parents</li>
        <li>2. One-child rural daughter of migrant workers (left-behind child)</li>
        <li>3. Rural daughter with a younger brother, raised by her parents</li>
        <li>4. One-child rural daughter whose father dies or her parents divorce</li>
        <li>5. Urban one-child daughter raised by her parents</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Relying on what the students learned in the various topic groups, they will work together to describe the most likely pathway this girl will take in her life. This will require that students share information they learned in their earlier group discussions with each other so they can make informed decisions at each juncture of her life. This pathway exploration should include her experiences of being a junior high school student, a senior high school or vocational student, and a college or vocational student. Then, the girl’s likely occupation should be determined, followed by what is likely to happen to her as she approaches the age of marriage, along with what motherhood and caregiving are likely to be for her. At each step, the group will be asked to provide a brief explanation of why it made the choices it did for this girl.</p>
    <p>To chart this girl’s life course, each group will create a pathway map – a roadmap of this girl’s life – in which they visually represent and mark the girl’s significant junctures with images or symbols and words. If time permits, each group will present its pathway map to the rest of the class. A visual gallery of these maps, showing life courses for girls in China as they assume the roles ascribed to women, can be displayed on classroom walls. Or, if the class is technically savvy, ask students to recreate their maps digitally and develop a presentation on a class website. </p>
