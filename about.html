<p><span class="lead-c">T</span><em>ouching Home in China: in search of missing girlhoods</em> is a transmedia project unfolding in six stories across multiple platforms. As teenagers, two American adoptees returned to the rural towns where their birth families abandoned them. There they hung out with girls who grew up there; the Chinese girls offered the Americans a ground-level view of what their own girlhoods might have been like in rural China. The girls’ lives diverged dramatically at birth, so they navigated the uncharted territory of reconnection by constructing bridges of understanding across the challenging terrain of their foreign ways and beliefs. As Chinese-born daughters growing up in American Caucasian families, the two teen adoptees personify the transracial experience of searching for self-identity in multicultural America. As only-child daughters, the Chinese girls illuminate the dizzying pace of changes taking place across many realms of daily life in contemporary China.</p>

<p>Join us on an interactive journey with two teen adoptees from America as they return to the towns in China where each was abandoned as a newborn. Girls who grew up in these towns reveal to the Americans what their girlhoods might have been like had their lives not diverged so dramatically as babies. The Americans share the realities of their distant upbringing – opening a
fascinating cross-cultural dialogue. </p>

<h3>Stories </h3>

<p>The stories on this website are also told on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/author/melissa-ludtke/id901521745?mt=11">six Apple iBooks in our series <em>Touching Home in China.</em></a> Each can be downloaded for optimal viewing on an Apple device. You will need the iBooks app, free in iTunes, to view the stories.</p>

<h4> Abandoned Baby </h4>
<p>Two girl babies are abandoned in the mid-1990s under China’s one-child policy and adopted by American families. As China confronts the societal impacts of its extreme gender imbalance, these girls – Jennie and Maya - return as teens to find out what their lives as Chinese daughters might have been like.</p>

<h4> Touching Home</h4>
<p>Girls who grew up in the rural towns where Maya and Jennie were abandoned greet them upon arrival. The Chinese and American girls discover kinship in their shared beginnings and set out to explore differences of experience and attitude that their distant childhoods created.</p>

<h4> Daughter. Wife. Mother.</h4>
<p>Raised as only-child daughters, six Chinese girls guide Jennie and Maya through their childhoods, describing their family circumstances and experiences as girls. In their mid-20s, they are likely to be wives, and soon after moms, if generational patterns hold. Yet in rapidly changing China, women’s family lives are in flux.</p>          

<h4> Learning About Learning</h4>
<p>The Americans girls’ learning experiences bear little resemblance to those of their Chinese friends. In comparing their school and out-of-school activities, each girl better appreciates how her country’s approach to education shapes the different ways she thinks – even about what it means to “learn.” </p>

<h4> Women’s Work</h4>
<p>Growing up, the Chinese girls did household chores expected of rural daughters. They saw married women working menial factory jobs or farming. Job prospects seem better for them due to their additional years of education; for some, college can be a gateway to a career. Yet bias against women pervades workplaces.</p>

<h4> The Girls Reflect</h4>
<p>When these “hometown” girls met, Maya and Jennie were the first foreigners the Chinese girls had ever seen. They didn’t know that girls born in their towns were abandoned and then adopted by families outside of China. In saying good-bye, the girls reflect on enduring lessons learned from their time together.</p>
