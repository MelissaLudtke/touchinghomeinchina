<div class="main-content">

<p><span class="lead-c">T</span>eacher Hu Xingmei pauses outside
the classroom door as students sit and ready their textbooks for today’s
lessons.</p>

<p>“Class now begins,” Miss Hu announces as she enters the classroom in Xiaxi Junior Middle School.</p>

<p>“Stand up!” a student leader commands. Classmates alertly rise among tightly packed desks. </p>

<p>“Good morning, boys and girls,” Hu says. “Good morning, Miss Hu,” they reply in unison. In some classrooms in China, students and teacher bow to one another. Not in hers. &quot;Please sit down,” she says.</p>
<p>Instantly, class gets underway. English and Chinese lessons happen in the hours soon after students get to school at about six o’clock each morning. The school day ends for seventh and eighth graders at 4:50; ninth graders go home 40 minutes later.</p>
<p>If my daughter, Maya, whom I adopted in China when she was nine months old, wasn’t abandoned as a newborn, her birth family might have raised her in Xiaxi Town. She might have sat among the 30 to 40 students in Miss Hu’s classroom to learn English. Instead, Maya studied Mandarin at her high school in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In the month before her senior year, she returned to this farming town where her life began. With “hometown” girls who could have been childhood friends, Maya learned what it’s like to grow up as a daughter in this rural town.</p>
<p>In getting to know each other, the Chinese and American girls share what’s been the dominant experience of their young lives: learning.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; They find out that the ways they learn, which feel natural to them, appear odd to their foreign friends. This chasm in the girls’ school experiences mirrors what scholars find in their two nations’ vastly different approaches to educating their young. The cultural values of each country are woven intricately into classroom practices. What and how each girl learns informs, in turn, how she interacts with the larger world and views her possibilities in it.</p>
<p>Scholars analyzing education in China highlight this contrast. In her book <i>Cultural Foundations of Learning</i>, Brown University Professor <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/jili">Jin Li</a> maps requisite qualities of Chinese students using words such as hardship, respect for authority, self-exertion, diligence, humility and perseverance. These key attributes of learning, she notes, are <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2015/09/21/respect-your-elders-confucian-kindergartens-catch-on-in-china/">grounded in Confucian values</a>. Western teachers, on the other hand, endorse students’ active engagement, creativity, curiosity, and their ability to communicate ideas as they challenge authoritative knowledge. Li summarizes the Chinese way as “virtue-oriented” and the Western one as “mind-oriented.”</p>

<p>Maya and her new Chinese friends ignore such labels as they exchange learning experiences. In plainspoken, girl-to-girl conversations they just tell each other “here’s how I learn,” casting away the overhangs of judgment that often curtail cross-cultural exploration.
</p>

    <img class="caligraphy" src="images/learning/calligraphy/school-days.jpg">
School Days
</h3>

<p>On Maya’s first full day in Xiaxi, Teacher Hu shows her around the school. It is August, so classes are not in session. As they walk down white tiled-corridors past empty classrooms, Hu translates some of the messages on the walls exhorting students to work hard and obey the rules.</p>

<div id="gallery12" style="width: 500px;" class="img img-half right gallery"> <img src="images/galleries/12/1-xiaxi-school-thumb.jpg" alt="1-xiaxi-school-thumb"/> <div class="caption-text" style="max-width:700px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"> <span class="caption-title" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">Xiaxi Junior Middle School</span> </div> </div>


<p>Maya emerges with “a kind of a strange”
sense of belonging in this place. “Miss Hu felt she could connect with me
because I look like some of her students,” Maya tells Jennie, who was her crib
neighbor at their orphanage in nearby Changzhou and is now Maya’s companion on
this journey back to the rural towns where each of them was abandoned. “Miss Hu
told me she thought I would have worked hard at her school. It felt emotional
because I had a clear picture of what my life would have been like, the teacher
I would have had, the school I would have gone to.”</p>

<p>From 1982 until 1985, Hu attended
junior middle school in her family’s village of Sanxing, not far from the
center of Xiaxi Town. Only about a tenth of her classmates tested well enough
to go on to senior middle school, which is what Americans know as high school.
She was one of them. For the next three years, she attended Xiaxi Middle
School, in buildings located where she teaches now.</p>

<p>Back then, families generally made
sure their <a
href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/02/chinas-great-gender-crisis">sons
were educated</a>, and only when resources permitted did they send their
daughters to school, sometimes for only a few years. Hu’s parents had two
daughters, so no brothers competed for the family’s resources to pay school
fees. At the end of twelfth grade, Hu scored high enough on the <i><a
href="http://chineseculture.about.com/od/historyofchina/fl/The-Gaokao.htm">gaokao,</a></i> the university entrance exam, and
went to the nearby city of Changzhou to study. After two years at the university
and marriage to a college-educated chemist who also grew up in Xiaxi, Hu began
to teach English. They raised their only child, a daughter, in Xiaxi.</p>

<p>From where Hu sat then to where she
stands now, she sees huge changes in the daily lives of students. “When I was a
child, our study life was not so hard as it is today,” Hu says. “We didn’t have
so much homework so after school we helped our parents do some farm work. I
could do many things other than study when I was a little girl, like wash clothes,
clean the house, and get grass for our goats to eat.”</p>

    <div class="caption-text"><span class="caption-title">Teacher Hu Reflects</span>Hu Xingmei, an English teacher at Xiaxi Junior Middle School, compares her school experiences with her students'.</div>
</div>

<p>China’s economy is much stronger now
and living conditions in Xiaxi have greatly improved since Hu was a child. Back
then families and teachers of China’s elite were the ones to emphasize that
dedicated study leads to academic achievement. Now rural families echo this
Confucian idea, prodding their only child (or, in some families, a pair of
siblings) to <a
href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/06/30/in-chinas-cutthroat-academic-competition-ruining-generation-of-youth-gaokao-wealth-power/">compete
for highly prized university seats</a>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
As a consequence, “the students have fewer and fewer activities outside
of school,” Hu says. “They spend most of their time in the classroom because
students in other schools do it like this. So if we don’t do it the same way,
maybe our students will not get good results on the exam. When I was young, we
didn’t have so much pressure as the students do today.”</p>


<h3>
    <img class="caligraphy" src="images/learning/calligraphy/gaokao.jpg"/>Gaokao
</h3>

<p>The <i>gaokao</i> score is the <a
href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/07/china-gaokao_n_1578905.html">sole
academic determinant</a> of a student’s admission to a university in China.
Youngsters begin absorbing the significance of the <i>gaokao</i> score as early
as primary school. In farming towns like Xiaxi, families and teachers view this
college entrance exam as the “great equalizer.” Motivational messages remind
rural high school students of this exam’s importance: “Without <i>gaokao</i>,
how can you beat the children of the rich?”</p>

<p>Early in June, twelfth graders
endure this several-day exam that is largely a multiple-choice ordeal. In the
preceding months and weeks, students throughout China skip meals and sleep as
they memorize answers and take multiple rounds of practice tests until late
into the night. While they study, <a
href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1527044/lucky-prayers-gaokao-exam-lifetime-millions-would-be-university-students">family
members visit local temples</a> or statues of Confucius and leave gifts to
bring good fortune. Chinese media play their predictable role by publishing
photographs of students’ extreme devotion to study. There’s the girl at her
desk who <a
href="http://www.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/html1/news/newsmakers/16/8854-1.htm">attaches
her hair to a hanger</a> with clothespins so she’ll be jolted awake if her head
dips towards sleep. Or the <a
href="http://www.businessinsider.com/24-stunning-photos-of-chinas-college-entrance-exams-2015-6">students
wearing oxygen masks</a> with their eyes fixed on schoolbooks. </p>

<p>Families usually accompany their
students to the test site. They rent hotel rooms where their children can rest
between exam sessions. Traffic is blocked from nearby streets, and authorities
restrict noise in area surrounding the test site. Each day of the exam the
students from Xiaxi say goodbye to parents and grandparents at the gates of a
high school in Changzhou. When they emerge after the final test, their families
are there to greet them with flowers and gifts.</p>


<div id="gallery13" style="width:700px;" class="img img-full gallery"> <img src="images/galleries/13/1-crowd-changzhou-thumb.jpg" alt="1-crowd-changzhou-thumb"/> <div class="caption-text" style="max-width:700px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"> <span class="caption-title" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">A Family Affair</span> </div> </div>

<p>Sometime during the days of testing,
students will be asked to <a
href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/08/asia/china-gaokao-national-exams/index.html">select
an essay topic</a> from a set of prompts. <a
href="http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/the-satirical-relief-after-chinas-pressure-cooker-college-exam/">They
earn a high score</a> when they skillfully knit together evidence of their deep
classical knowledge with keen awareness of current events. A prompt from the
2012 <i>gaokao</i> illuminates the challenge: “Old Ji is a railway security
man, and he works on a mountain. His job is to examine the railways to prevent
the fallen stones and trees from affecting the trains. He salutes every time
the train passes, and the train honks its horn in return. What do these scenes
remind you of?”</p>

<p>The essay score is part of the
cumulative <i>gaokao</i> score. It’s added to scores in math, Chinese, a
foreign language (usually English), and a subject cluster – either science,
which is largely quantitative, or humanities, with more open-ended questions.
Universities admit students <a
href="http://www.economist.com/news/china/21592664-proportion-rural-students-university-has-declined-dramatically-not-educating-masses">based
on their <i>gaokao</i> score</a>; they require no personal essay,
recommendation letters, or roundup of extracurricular activities and community
service that could showcase a student’s different strengths.</p>

<p>“In China, we just pay more
attention to the students’ exam points, and by doing that we ignore their other
abilities,” Miss Hu explains. “As a result, many students can’t do some things
with their hands. They are just good at doing exams.”</p>

<p>This regimented, stress-inducing
preparation for the <i>gaokao</i> is leading more of China’s exceptional <a
href="http://www.iie.org/Services/Project-Atlas/United-States/International-Students-In-US">students
to apply to universities overseas</a>. If America is their chosen destination,
they attend SAT and TOFEL (English language) preparatory courses. Seeing the
outflow of top students, Chinese education officials are <a
href="http://english.caixin.com/2014-12-19/100765295.html">acting to reform the
<i>gaokao</i></a><i>. </i>These changes will add flexibility to the entire
process of test taking as well as encourage changes in university admission.</p>

<p>As Maya learns about learning from
girls in Xiaxi, she comes away with a similar sense as Hu about the intense
focus on exams. Maya’s new friends’ ideas about what it means to be “smart”
contrast with her own sense of that word. “Being smart is about the high
ranking a teacher gives them,” <a
href="http://cn.nytstyle.com/education/20151218/t18essaycontest-mayaxia/dual/">Maya
wrote in an essay</a> about what she learned from her Chinese friends, “and
studying is their only way of getting there.” Maya surprises her Chinese
friends when she describes what she learns from out-of-school activities, such
as her environmental activism and dance. To their way of thinking, those
experiences aren’t real learning since they don’t happen in a classroom and she
isn’t being tested. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <p> Today, fewer twelfth graders in China choose to follow the country’s prescribed path to a university. Instead of preparing for the <em>gaokao</em>, China’s ultra-competitive university admission test, increasing numbers of China’s brightest teens study for the SAT and apply to U.S. universities. Between 2010 and 2015, the number of Chinese students enrolled in U.S. universities nearly doubled; during this same period, enrollment of Chinese students in U.S. primary and secondary schools nearly quadrupled.</p>

    <p> This exodus has ignited efforts to transform classroom teaching in China. Education officials want the centuries-old model of rote memorization of specified lessons to make way for teaching approaches emphasizing analytical thinking. They are making key changes in the kind of learning of the <em>gaokao</em> measures. They also want high school students to be given opportunities to choose what they want to study by having schools offer a broader range of courses.</p>
    <p> Once reforms are in place, students will select <em>gaokao</em> scores on three subjects among six possibilities to submit to universities: biology, chemistry, geography, history, physics and politics. When they apply, students will indicate their prospective major in college. Maximum scores for the foreign language test (usually English) will be reduced from 150 to 100, while the value of the Chinese score will rise from 150 to 180. All twelfth graders will still be tested in Chinese and math in the usual June <em>gaokao</em>, but students will now have a second chance to take the foreign language and elective subjects. Students’ scores will remain valid for two years, instead of one. </p> 
    <p>In addition, the <em>gaokao</em> score will no longer be the sole factor to determine a student’s university admission. Applications will include records of students’ physical health, along with their “morality standards, art cultivation and social practice.” Volunteer activities will earn extra points. </p>
    <p>These changes were piloted in Zhejiang province and Shanghai during the 2015-2016 school year. That experience suggests that stiff resistance is likely to greet these changes.</p>
</div>

<p>With most families in Xiaxi raising
one child, that student’s score on two key exams – one at the end of ninth
grade, the other at the end of twelfth – configure the odds that her family
will advance to a higher rung on the ladder of economic mobility. Yet even when
students in rural regions score exceptionally high on the <i>gaokao</i>, they
often need to leap additional hurdles to secure a seat at a top university.
This is because a student’s <i>hukuo,</i> the official residency document, <a
href="http://www.womenofchina.cn/html/womenofchina/report/171862-1.htm">plays a
complex role</a> in determining which university she will attend. Hindered by
the scarcer resources available for her primary and secondary schools, this
rural student is disadvantaged again by an admission process favoring those
with an urban <i>hukuo</i>. A <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/opinion/sunday/chinas-education-gap.html?_r=0">recent
analysis revealed</a> that a Beijing student is 41 times more likely to be
admitted to Peking University, China’s toughest seat to attain, than a student
in largely rural Anhui province.</p>

<div class="img img-half" >
    <img src="images/learning/education-levels-graph.jpg" alt='education-levels-graph'/>
    <div class="caption-text">Source: UNESCO</div>
</div>

<p>Girls also have a tougher time being
admitted to a good university since they need to <a
href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/20/world/la-fg-china-female-students-20130221">score
higher than boys</a> from their region to be given a seat. Requiring girls to
score higher is China’s way of safeguarding the gender balance at this advanced
level of schooling. As more girls are raised as only children, they’ve become
better educated than when brothers received the larger share of families’
school resources. Given the opportunity to learn, girls outperform boys in
primary and secondary school, and despite their obstacle to college entry (and
fewer girls in the population) more young women than men are enrolled in
undergraduate and graduate programs.</p>

<p>Preparing for the <i>gaokao</i> is <a
href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1769017/cramming-college-beijings-second-high">grueling</a>.
The monotony of classroom exercises and repetitious nighttime study escalates
in rigor and hours as students advance toward the final tortuous year of
twelfth grade. Hu’s daughter, Xue Piao, says school “bored” her. Still, neither
boredom nor sleepiness – from her nightly hours devoted to homework drills –
could excuse inattentiveness. She had to pay attention so she’d remember
exactly what the teachers presented in class and know the correct answers on
the test. “Every day we had tests and every week we had a big exam,” she says.
“I felt sleepy but I couldn’t afford to sleep because the scores were
important.”</p>

<div class="video right">
          <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/160767392" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <div class="caption-text"><span class="caption-title"> Tough Times at School </span> Tiara, Maya and Jennie compare notes on their teachers.</div>
</div>


<p>Piao, who uses her English name,
Tiara, with Maya and Jennie, describes how teachers post students’ test scores
in class next to their names. “There was an average score,” Tiara explains.
“Those who scored under that average, the teacher would find them and blame it
on them. There would be shame if you got low scores.”</p>

<p>“Those who score low, how do they
respond?” she’s asked.</p>

<p>“Work harder and get higher scores,”
Tiara replies, as though that is the only possible response. “And next time
they will be in the top,” she says, smiling.</p>

<p>Having had a Mandarin teacher who was
educated in China, Maya relates to this dynamic. “My teacher did that in
Chinese class,” she tells Tiara. “Then he would go around and give a talk about
how we were not good enough and why he wasn’t happy with us. He did this with
every test, every person, no matter what the score was.”</p>

<p>Tiara nods, perhaps relieved to hear
that this happens in America, too.</p>

<p>Jennie listens with a look of
wonderment. She never studied Chinese and hasn’t had this kind of experience.
Teachers at her high school, she says, “might show grades on the board, but
they never put a name with them.”</p>

<p>The expression “Gain one point,
surpass a thousand people” is popular with students on Chinese social media.
Instead of using the usual character for “surpass” (<i>chaoguo</i>), this
online phrase uses <i>gandiao</i>, a word that implies a killing. As Yifu Dong,
who graduated recently from a top high school in Beijing, <a
href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/06/30/in-chinas-cutthroat-academic-competition-ruining-generation-of-youth-gaokao-wealth-power/">observed
in an article</a> he wrote: “Neither the language nor the sentiment behind it
[this phrase] is likely to strike Chinese students as unusual.” It expresses
the fierce competitiveness ingrained in students who study until finally they
reach the end of their endurance. </p>

<p>Heavy emphasis on testing success in
China means that schools rarely teach non-academic topics, including <a

education</a>. When bodily health is talked about, neither teachers nor
students take it seriously. “We just take those tests [about sex education],
but the teacher tells us the answers so it’s like we don’t have it,” Tiara
tells Maya and Jennie. Other girls in Xiaxi and Xixiashu mention to the
Americans that they’ve heard a few things said about girls’ safety, but not
much else.</p>

she should go outside with her friends. Then she can protect herself.”</p>



<p>Confucian values promote sexual
modesty for women, even if such beliefs have gradually lost their hold over
what actually happens. Sexual activity, absent preventive guidance in school or
by families, leads to consequences such as a recent rapid increase in HIV
infection in young people. A <a

and education” by Peking University and the United Nations Population Fund
found that only four percent of women aged 15 to 25 “displayed adequate
knowledge of sexual and reproductive health.” </p>

Shaming my Family
</h3>
<p>Of more than nine million students
who take the <i>gaokao</i> each year, roughly one-third fail to get into an
academic university. Those who fall short often end up at overcrowded “<a
href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/10/11/chinas-cram-school-from-hell/">cram
schools</a>” where hundreds of students sit in rooms and perform practice
drills. They will take the exam again the following June. Fences ring interior
balconies of some schools acting as <a
href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/11551660/Chinese-school-installs-anti-suicide-barriers-before-dreaded-exam.html">barriers
against attempted suicides</a>. In 2014, <a
href="http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/05/15/chinas-cutthroat-school-system-leads-to-teen-suicides/">Chinese
officials examined apparent causes of student suicides</a> and concluded that
more than 90 percent occurred “after arguments with teachers or were attributed
to the intense pressure to study put on young people.”</p>

<p>If these youngsters don’t improve
their <i>gaokao</i> score, they will not be admitted to a university for
academic study. The alternative is either to enter the workforce – for rural
Chinese, most likely as a <a
href="http://factsanddetails.com/china/cat11/sub72/item150.html">migrant worker</a>
– or to enroll in a vocational program.</p>

<p>On the day Jennie meets Jin Shan,
she sits with family members around a wooden table in Shan’s paternal
grandmother’s house in Xixiashu. Pei Adi, her 66-year-old grandmother, grew up
in a small dirt house in Xixiashu and barely attended school. As the oldest
daughter, family duties ended her education early. Chen Liuhong, Shan’s 41-year
old mother, is the third child (second daughter) in a family that had resources
for her to finish middle school. After that, Liuhong began years of work as a
migrant tailor before she and her husband, a local man who completed only
primary school, returned home to Xixiashu. Now they own a store where they sell
steel for local construction.</p>

<p>Shan’s faded school certificates decorate
the long concrete interior wall of her grandparents’ home. She was raised in
this house after her parents left her at seven months old when they went to
find work in distant northern cities. They returned when she was in junior
middle school.</p>

<p>“Are you the first to go to college
in your family?” Jennie asks Shan. All she knows is that Shan took the <i>gaokao</i>
in June. Shan responds in English so that her grandmother and mother will not
understand. “Yes, just for construction,” she says, alluding to a
less-than-hoped-for vocational assignment.</p>

          <div class="caption-text"><span class="caption-title"> Three Generations of Schooling </span>Shan, her mother and paternal grandmother tell Jennie about their different levels of education.</div>
        </div>

<p>A few days before Jennie arrived,
Shan learned that her <i>gaokao</i> score was too low to qualify for an
academic seat at a university. It was high enough, though, for her to enroll in
a <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/185280.htm">vocational
program</a> at a university; she wasn’t yet sure which one it would be. </p>

<p>“My parents had high hopes,” she
tells Jennie, softly. “So they are not proud of me. They hoped for me go to a
good college and study knowledge. But I can’t. So they are not proud of me, I
think.”</p>

<p>As the girls get to know each other,
Shan tells Jennie how “most families and students put their dreams in <i>gaokao</i>.”
To become a doctor, a teacher or other high-status professional, Shan explains,
“first they should do their best on the <i>gaokao</i> and get a high score and
they will enter a good university. Then, maybe they’ll realize their dreams and
maybe later when they are parents or grandparents, their life will be better.”
When she was little, Shan remembers her parents would say to her “you should
study harder and harder and then you can go to a good university.” By the time
she was in middle school, “my parents gave me so much stress. They wanted me to
go to a good high school, where I will get a better education and it will be easier
to enter a good university,” she says.</p>

<p>At the end of ninth grade Shan
passed the exam to get into senior middle school. Still, school bored her, so
she wasn’t motivated to do the hard work required in the upper grades. Shan
knew her parents expected her to perform well on the <i>gaokao</i>, so
throughout her teen years she felt the stress of not meeting her parents’
expectations. She feared she would not pass the <i>gaokao</i> – and those fears
turned out to be true.</p>

<p>After the American girls depart in
late August, Jennie and Maya start their senior years at public high schools in
Massachusetts. Like nearly all of their classmates, they visit and apply to
many universities and colleges. At the same time, Shan travels 90 miles from
Xiaxi to become a first-year student at Nantong Vocational College in northeast
Jiangsu province.</p>

        </div>


<p>By the end of her first year, Shan
sounds happy and more self-assured, even if she is a bit homesick, especially
for home cooking. She believes that her parents are moving past their initial
anger and disappointment with her <i>gaokao</i> result and now realize that
construction suits her well. With contacts in the industry, her parents seem
confident she’ll find a job. Shan likes being among the few girls majoring in
construction; most of them live in one narrow dorm room with bunk beds lining
the walls. “In high school, I wasn’t interested in Chinese or math and all
those subjects,” she says, “At the university, I’m interested in construction
so I think I’ll do well and find a good job.”</p>

Path Setting Test

<p>The <i>gaokao</i> is years away for
Miss Hu’s junior middle school students. Their immediate focus is to prepare
for a different exam called the <i><a
href="http://www.chinaeducation.info/Standardised-Tests/K12-Tests/zhong-kao-examination.html">zhongkao<span
style='font-style:normal'>.</a></i> Ninth graders must pass this
challenging test to be admitted to a senior middle school. </p>

<p>To achieve this is to endure
tediously long hours of memorization. Tiara recalls that her junior middle
school day ended about 12 hours after it began early each morning. At school,
she walked by messages like this: “If today we don't bury ourselves in books
and study hard, how can we raise our heads up and be men tomorrow?” Then, at
home, she “worked every night until midnight doing those sheets of paper and
preparing for my final exams of junior school,” she says.</p>

  <p>Motivational words appear on the walls and columns at Xiaxi Junior Middle School. They reinforce precepts of Confucian learning. Since Confucianism teaches that humans are not born with the necessary virtues and moral sensibilities to achieve lifelong learning, students must internalize humility and practice perseverance if &quot;great learning&quot; is to occur. Brown University professor Jin Li observes that this process &quot;is fraught with challenges, temptations, and disappointments – thus requiring unflagging resolve and steadfast persistence.&quot; (Click on columns above for translations).</p>

<p>Yan Yujiao, one of Maya’s acquaintances in Xiaxi, aspires to become a news anchor. She scored very high on the June <i>zhongkao</i> exam, so while Maya is visiting, Yujiao packs her bags and leaves Xiaxi to begin tenth grade at a top senior middle school in Changzhou’s Wujin district. During the next three years, with occasional weekends at home, Yujiao’s days and nights will be directed toward one goal: success on the <i>gaokao</i>. </p>

<p>But the scores of 60 to 70 percent of Yujiao’s peers at Xiaxi Junior Middle School were too low to earn a seat at a senior middle school. They had two options: either start working or enroll in a vocational boarding school for training. Sixteen-year-old Chen knows her low <i>zhongkao</i> score had erased her possibility of ever taking the <i>gaokao</i>.</p>

<p>When she was seven years old, Chen’s parents divorced and both moved away, leaving her to be raised by her paternal grandparents, who are farmers. While urban families often bolster classroom lessons with out-of-school educational activities and tutoring, such extras aren’t part of most rural children’s lives. Like other <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/11/asia/china-left-behind-kids/index.html">rural elders raising “left-behind” children</a>, Chen’s grandmother attended just a year of primary school, her grandfather not many more – leaving them ill-prepared to boost Chen’s academic prospects. </p>

    <div class="caption-text"><span class="caption-title"> Sixteen and Away from Home </span>Chen muses on her life at a vocational boarding school.</div>
</div>

<p>Chen loves singing, especially Western songs. On walks in Xiaxi, Chen sings the English lyrics to music she plays on her mobile phone. When Maya returns to the United States in September, Chen leaves Xiaxi to live in a dormitory at a vocational school in the nearby city of Changzhou. She is among more than 11 million students to enroll in <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/185280.htm">technical or vocational schools</a> each year in China; some 15,000 of these schools serve students like Chen who are in their mid-teens. </p>
 
<p>By Lunar New Year, Chen relishes her
independence. Her major area of study is computer networks, but what she enjoys
most about school is the freedom to hang out with friends and listen to music.
Chen also has taken her first job as a waitress in an upscale restaurant near
her school. She wants to earn spending money and, as she puts it, “toughen
herself.” Doing a job, she says, is her way “to feel the real world.” After a
few months, she’s apparently had enough of the real world and quits the job.
Singing still inhabits her dreams.</p>

<p> Chinese officials worry that the nation’s system of vocational education training (VET) serves neither the students’ futures nor the country’s economic needs. Job training and classroom instruction are weak at most of these schools, Chinese educators acknowledge. A <a href="http://reap.fsi.stanford.edu/research/vocational_education_versus_academic_high_school_a_study_on_relative_value_added">Stanford University review</a> confirms this view: “Some VET schools seem to be no more than recruiting grounds for factories,” the review concludes. Students drop out at a higher rate than those at academic high schools. According to the Stanford researchers, “Even when we compare VET students with the worst academic high school students in their schools, attending a vocational high school reduces general skills and does not lead to gains in specific skills (relative to attending academic high school).” </p>
<p>Jennie’s friend in Xixiashu, Zheng Fan, also went from junior middle school into a vocational training school due to her low <i>zhongkao</i> score. Unlike Chen, Fan enjoys school and feels a strong obligation to her parents to do well in her studies. She tells Jennie that she’s working hard in her study of customs declaration and international freight. Her parents favor this pathway for their only child; being a customs official would provide a stable and secure life for her as a government employee.</p>
<p>When she was younger, Fan’s dreams were different. “I wanted to be a kindergarten teacher because I think little children are all very lovely. Or a doctor,” she says. “My brother died of a brain tumor when he was five years old, and my father and mother were very sad. I’m the second child in my family, so I listen to my parents and I do the things they want. I very much respect them and love them. I want to give them a better life.”</p>
<p>Both of Fan’s parents work in factories; her father makes paint, her mother makes clothing labels. Desire to do better for her family fuels Fan’s hunger for learning. “I do my best and put in more effort. I am very hard-working and very confident,” she says. “My actions revolve around my parents’ beliefs and standards. I believe the most important people in the world are your parents. In life you encounter many people you can’t trust, but you can always trust your parents. Everything they do is for your benefit because you came from their blood and they would never want to harm you. This is why I believe one must obey one’s parents.”</p>
<p>Fan’s perseverant attitude reaps rewards. In the summer after Jennie’s visit, Fan completes her four years of vocational school and applies to Changzhou University to continue her studies. She intends to graduate at 22 with a major in business English. Since she didn’t attend an academic high school, Fan can’t study in Changzhou University’s academic program, so she’ll be a <i><a href="http://www.classbase.com/Countries/China/Credentials">zhuanke graduate</a></i>, earning a certificate, not a university degree. After graduating, she hopes to find a steady job in foreign trade.</p>
 
<h3> <img class="caligraphy" src="images/learning/calligraphy/coming-to-america.jpg"> Coming to America </h3>

<p>Hu’s daughter, Tiara, decided early in her first year of senior middle school that she didn’t want to take the <i>gaokao</i>. Tiara told her mother that she wanted to study instead for the SAT and <a href="http://www.examenglish.com/TOEFL/">TOFEL</a> exams so she could apply to American colleges. “She said her math was not so good,” says Hu. “In China, if your math is not good, then you can’t get good results in <i>gaokao</i> because there are so many points in math.” Tiara feared that her <i>gaokao</i> score would not match either her or her parents’ expectations for a good university education. “It was a very good idea,” Hu says. “I supported her. So did her father. We supported her all the way.”</p>
<p>Tiara traveled 56 miles and stayed in Suzhou for six months to attend an SAT preparation class. “The SAT is much easier than the <i>gaokao</i>,” Tiara says, though she admits she didn’t study hard enough to do as well as she could have. She did not get into her first-choice university.</p>
<p>“Most students in Chinese universities find campus life boring,” she says. “My life in an American university may be a challenge for me, but I am willing to take it because I hope my future life will be more exciting.”</p>
<p>Tiara’s fellow SAT students imagine America to be “a melting pot … so many different kinds of people, different kinds of cultures there,” based on what they’ve heard from Chinese students already there. “We can learn many new things that we didn’t know before. So it’s the perfect place for us to go.”</p>
<p>Many of her peers agree. In 2015, there were 304,040 Chinese students enrolled in U.S. universities, more than from any other country. In each of the past eight years, there’s been a double-digit increase in the number of <a href="http://www.iie.org/Research-and-Publications/Open-Doors/Data/Fact-Sheets-by-Country/2015">students from China studying at American universities and colleges</a>. In 2015 there were almost twice as many Chinese students in the U.S. as five years earlier – many of them young women like Tiara who are advantaged by China’s one-child policy. In contrast, only 13,763 Americans studied at a Chinese university the year that Tiara came to the United States, a 4.5 percent decrease from the previous year.</p>

    <div class="caption-text"><span class="caption-title"> Joining the Student Exodus </span>Tiara's first year at Syracuse University reveals eye-opening differences between Chinese and American campus life.</div>
</div>

<p>Maya and Jennie see Tiara off as she
leaves for the Shanghai airport. This is Tiara’s first time in the United
States. She stays for a few days in Boston with a Chinese friend before taking
a bus to Syracuse University, which she chose from among four American schools
that admitted her. She plans to major in international relations.</p>

<p>Tiara’s studies go well, but she must <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/11/30/the-girl-from-harvard-the-girl-from-china-us-china-education-culture-differences/">adjust to cultural differences</a>. For starters, male students live in the dorm room next to hers; in China, she says, male students aren’t allowed to enter women’s dorms. At Syracuse, everyone on the corridor uses the same bathrooms. Then, there are the parties: “I am not a party animal, but I go to some on Friday nights. Americans really know how to play,” she observes, laughing at recollections of those evenings. “Yeah, they really know how to enjoy themselves. They dance. They drink alcohol, even though it’s not permitted. You can see they’re so happy. They can live their life. It’s a way to relax after working hard during the week. My Chinese friends and I relax by maybe driving to get some good Chinese food and talking to each other, so that’s different.”</p>

<p>Tiara appreciates that grades are kept private in the United States. Only she decides whether to study harder. “If you get a low GPA, you don’t have to be embarrassed. The only one who knows is you. All you have to do is maybe work harder.” She’s impressed by how “some Americans seem like they’re playing around every day, but then they do well in class. You don’t see them sitting there and studying, but they still do well.” Shaking her head, she says, “I still don’t get that.”</p>

<p>When she’s with other Asian students, it’s hard to break the habit of talking about scores. “Not every day, but after exams we’re talking about, ‘Hey, how much did you get for this class?’” she says. “But American students don’t really care about that. One of my Chinese friends was getting an A in chemistry and he was showing off around the dorm, ‘Hey, I’m getting and A in chemistry.’ But nobody cared. It seemed so weird for him to do that.”</p>

</div>

 <p>Tiara likes being around girls of all nationalities who are striving to reach conventionally male goals, as she is. “In China, dream jobs for girls are mostly like teachers or maybe nurses. My dream is to be a diplomat. I seldom had girlfriends around me in China who shared this ambition. But in my international relations classes most of the girls want to get a job in the United Nations or something about politics, just like the boys. It’s really good to have someone to share your interests.”</p>

<p>By her junior year, Tiara has moved off campus and shares an apartment with a Chinese student who’s been her closest friend since freshman year. To celebrate the Harvest Moon festival, they invite friends to join them in <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Moon-Cakes">making mooncakes</a> and share a meal. After graduation, Tiara plans to return to China and find work there. This is what her parents want her to do. “I am my parents’ only child, so it’s better for me to stay in China in the future,” she says.</p>
