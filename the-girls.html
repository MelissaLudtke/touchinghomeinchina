			moved away, remarried and seldom visits; her mother vanished. She
			loves music, especially Western-style singing, and rarely is without
			her cell phone booming songs. After junior high school, she went to in a training school in Changzhou, where she lived in a crowded dormitory room and took her first job at the local Ecological Garden Restaurant, where she set and cleared tables and washed dishes. </p>

Shan likes to draw, but after high school she enrolled in a nearby two-year college to study construction and found her first job stocking grocery store shelves.</p>

			Rongia Village, Xiaxiashu Town </p>
			<p>Fan’s mother and father work in local factories. Her father makes paint; her mother produces clothing labels. When her five-year-old brother died of a brain tumor, Fan decided she wanted to become a doctor. But her low score on the high school entrance exam meant that she had to attend a vocational training program. Her parents wanted her to be a customs officer — steady, secure employment. To please them, she majored in "customs declaration and international freight." </p>
